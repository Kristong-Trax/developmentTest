ASH (Segment???) doesn't seem to exist.
BEVERAGE & BEVERAGE A/AF is not a segment
Clarify base measure yogurt params- orignals are in ignore columns
yogurt variety count, what do results 1-5 SS, NO MPK; 1-5 SS, 1 MPK; 1-5 SS, 2 MPK; 6-10 SS, NO MPK; 6-10 SS, 1 MPK; 6-10 SS, 2 MPK; 11+ SS, NO MPK; 11+ SS, 1 MPK; 11+ SS, 2 MPK
    mean? This kpi will be almost identical to count_of

should adjacency anchor be limited to super category?

since this was set up with atomic style kpis, I am not saving numerator id's
score should be 1 if a result was found for things like adjacency, score 0 means empty result and is intended for use in the simon to count sessions or such
    i didn't quite do this for blocking as I haven't firmly settled on simon methodology

I'm assuming survey question will simply be handled in the simon, as it doesn't seem to need calculation

anchor list assumes that all potential segments, audiences whatevers have been listed in results
anchor list results are also a random medley from different columns.... see Const.REF_COLS
anchor currently ignores product type other, because if included everything would be continuous

What format variety exists in within the Kid Segment?- I don't see drink in the db in form_factor
